# eye-region-tracker

<<<<<<< HEAD
Need tracking.js in the same directory as eye-region-tracker. Uses GazeCapture's caffe models. 

Use inputProcess/faceCapture.html to collect photos and feature data that are to be processed. A caveat is that the downloads folder should be empty except for the photos and metadata and the first photo, wholeface.jpg is not used.

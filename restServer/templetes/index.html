   <b>Instructions:</b> <br>
<b>1)</b> The task is to look at the black dot as it traverses around the screen. It must be done on a laptop or monitor with a webcam, no smartphones please.<br>
<b>2)</b> Maximize your browser window so the black box stretches across your whole monitor. <br>
<b>3)</b> Make sure your face is entirely within the picture and well lit.<br>
<b>4)</b> Adjust lighting and positioning in order for your face to be detected.  <br>
<b>4a)</b> (When itâ€™s detected, dots and blocks will appear on your face. The start button will become activated when your face is being detected.)<br>
<b>5)</b> When ready, press the start button and your screen will center on the first black dot. It will take about 5 seconds to start moving. Once it does, follow the dot as naturally as possible. <br>
<b>6)</b> After three revolutions the tracking will stop and may take up to a minute or so to send the data that was collected. As long as more points are being added to the right text box, everything is working. Thank you for your patience.<br>
<b>7)</b> The second popup will tell you that the data is sent and it is safe to close the window.<br>
<b>8)</b> One trail is nice, but feel free to do multiple trials in different lighting setups and at different distances if you feel so inclined. <br>
<br>9)</b>  Thank You!
